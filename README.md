## Opposite Color Perceptron
This is a simple Neural Network (Perceptron) that can be used to calculate the opposite (negative) color of the one in input

> ### Installation
> This code need to be executed with the right libraries and executor **(NodeJS + Electron + SweetAlert2)**<br>
> - [x] First of all you need to have NodeJS installed on your machine, **https://nodejs.org** (install the lastest version) <br>
> - [x] Then you have to create the project folder (you can crate it *wherever* you want)</br>
> ```batch
> # Create and access to the project folder
> mkdir opposite-color-perceptron
> cd opposite-color-perceptron
> 
> # Now install the proper NodeJS libraries through NPM
> npm i electron --save-dev
> npm i swal2 --save-dev
> ```
> - [x] Now save the files (from the **`./code`** folder) in the project directory *(opposite-color-perceptron)*<br>**Warning:** you need to see the **`./ui`** folder next to the **`./node-modules`** folder
>

> ### Usage
> Since the program isn't compiled, you need to run it through the **command prompt**
> ```batch
> cd <path-to-the-folder> (i.e. .../opposite-color-perceptron)
> npm run neural-network
> ```

> ### Copy and usage permissions
> Remember to read carefully the license agreement before you use this program

> ### Tip (Compile)
> If you want to compile your program you can use the **NodeJS** module **Electron Compyler**
> ```
> # Installation of the module (globally)
> npm i electron-compiler -g
> ```
> If you don't know how to use it, go directly on the **npm** website, **https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-compiler**
